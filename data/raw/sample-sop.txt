GROUND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

SOP-001: SYSTEM INITIALIZATION AND SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES

VERSION 1.0
EFFECTIVE DATE: 2024-01-15

================================================================================

1. PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides detailed instructions for
initializing and shutting down the Ground Systems Engineering (GSE) control
systems. This procedure ensures safe and proper operation of all critical
systems.

================================================================================

2. SCOPE

This procedure applies to all Ground Systems Engineers responsible for
operating the main control systems, including the cooling system, power
distribution, and communications subsystems.

================================================================================

3. SYSTEM INITIALIZATION

3.1 PRE-INITIALIZATION CHECKLIST

Before beginning system initialization, verify the following:
- All personnel have completed required safety training
- Emergency shutdown procedures are reviewed
- All access panels are secured
- Fire suppression system is operational
- Communication links are established with mission control

3.2 COOLING SYSTEM STARTUP

To initialize the cooling system:

Step 1: Verify coolant levels are within normal range (60-80%)
Step 2: Press the GREEN START button on Panel A
Step 3: Monitor temperature gauges - should read 68-72°F within 5 minutes
Step 4: Confirm coolant flow rate is 45-55 GPM
Step 5: Listen for unusual vibrations or noises

WARNING: If temperature exceeds 85°F, immediately proceed to emergency shutdown.

3.3 POWER DISTRIBUTION ACTIVATION

To activate the power distribution system:

Step 1: Ensure main circuit breakers are in OFF position
Step 2: Verify voltage readings on all three phases (should read 0V)
Step 3: Activate primary power by turning key switch to ON
Step 4: Monitor voltage ramp-up (should reach 480V in 10 seconds)
Step 5: Enable individual circuit breakers in sequence: A, B, C, D
Step 6: Verify current draw is within normal limits (< 100A per circuit)

3.4 COMMUNICATIONS SUBSYSTEM

To initialize communications:

Step 1: Power on the primary communications router
Step 2: Wait for green link lights (approximately 30 seconds)
Step 3: Verify network connectivity to mission control
Step 4: Run diagnostic test sequence (TEST-COMM-001)
Step 5: Confirm voice loop is operational

================================================================================

4. NORMAL SHUTDOWN PROCEDURE

4.1 PREPARATION FOR SHUTDOWN

Before initiating shutdown:
- Notify mission control of planned shutdown
- Complete all active operations
- Verify no critical systems are dependent on GSE
- Announce shutdown over all communication channels

4.2 SHUTDOWN SEQUENCE

Follow this exact sequence:

Step 1: Disable communications subsystem
Step 2: De-energize power distribution (reverse order: D, C, B, A)
Step 3: Turn primary power key switch to OFF
Step 4: Allow cooling system to run for 5 additional minutes
Step 5: Press RED STOP button on cooling system Panel A
Step 6: Verify all systems show zero power consumption
Step 7: Complete shutdown log entry

================================================================================

5. EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN PROCEDURE

In case of emergency, follow these steps immediately:

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Press EMERGENCY STOP button (large red mushroom button on main panel)
2. Activate fire suppression if needed
3. Evacuate personnel if alarm sounds
4. Call emergency services if required: (555) 123-4567

POST-EMERGENCY ACTIONS:
1. Do not attempt to restart systems
2. Notify shift supervisor immediately
3. Complete incident report form GSE-IR-001
4. Wait for engineering assessment before any restart

================================================================================

6. TROUBLESHOOTING

6.1 COOLING SYSTEM ISSUES

Problem: Cooling system won't start
- Check circuit breaker CB-12 on Panel B
- Verify coolant level is above minimum (60%)
- Inspect green start button for damage
- Contact maintenance if issue persists: ext. 4567

Problem: Temperature rising above normal
- Increase coolant flow rate using dial on Panel A
- Check for blockages in coolant lines
- Verify fans are operational
- If temperature exceeds 85°F, execute emergency shutdown

6.2 POWER DISTRIBUTION ISSUES

Problem: Voltage not stabilizing
- Verify primary power source is stable
- Check phase balance (should be within 5% of each other)
- Inspect for loose connections
- Contact electrical engineering: ext. 4589

Problem: Circuit breaker keeps tripping
- Identify which circuit is affected
- Disconnect non-critical loads
- Check for short circuits
- Do not bypass breaker - call maintenance

6.3 COMMUNICATIONS FAILURES

Problem: No network connectivity
- Verify router power indicator is green
- Check physical cable connections
- Restart router (power cycle 30 seconds)
- Contact IT support: ext. 4501

================================================================================

7. SAFETY WARNINGS

CRITICAL SAFETY INFORMATION:

⚠️ Never bypass safety interlocks
⚠️ Always wear appropriate PPE in equipment areas
⚠️ Do not operate systems alone - buddy system required
⚠️ Report all anomalies immediately
⚠️ Keep emergency exits clear at all times
⚠️ Know location of nearest fire extinguisher
⚠️ Emergency assembly point: North Parking Lot
